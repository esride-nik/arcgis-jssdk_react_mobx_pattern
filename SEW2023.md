# React & ArcGIS SEW Presentation Prep
---

## Sam
* https://github.com/samMatenaer/arcgis-react-utils
* ArcLayer + ArcView components (=> try to put these into Nik's repo instead of the controller)
* useWatchEffect + useWatchStateto directly interact with MapView from Component => using local state for rendering
* focus on lightweight projects
* upside: less overhead, just use it where you need it
* downside: when used multiple times, add up to more code

## Nik
* https://github.com/esride-nik/react_jsapi_pattern
* central stage mgmt via MobX
* MapController copies watched values into MapStore => provides it to the rest of the app
* focus on large projects
* upside: write it once, use it everywhere
* downside: have to maintain central stores => overhead
